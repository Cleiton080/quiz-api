# Quiz API

I have been learning some technologies now, then I decided to began this simple project where I can practice my programming abilities. The endpoint is going to be written using ExpressJS and I am going to be using a relational database, Mysql. 

The Use Case is down below:

    }

__Parameters:__

## Database

The project is running _mysql_ at the production and development stage and the _sequelize_ are being used as an Object-Relational Mapping. We are not doing automated tests yet, but I want to use _sqlite3_ in memory later on.
